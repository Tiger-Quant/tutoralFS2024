## Getting Started

### Introduction to Python

**`python101.ipynb`** contains exercises on Python basics, including variables, loops, conditions, functions, complex datatypes, classes, and the popular libraries Pandas,
yFinance, and matPlotLib. The exercies have been modified from IMC Prosperity's programming resources on YouTube, and written by Evan Schreiner.

**`python101_solutions`** contains the solutions for all exercies in `python101.ipynb`. Note that any given solution is not exclusive, meaning there many be many solutions to 
a given problem! This document also contains further notes and commentary not included in the orignal.
